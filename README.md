  <p>Hello,</p>
  <Blockquote>My name is Ba. I'm a rusty coder that sometimes work on projects if it ever comes to mind. My github will most likely be a storage area for my projects, so 
  things with mostly likely will be finished, or unfinished. Though that does not mean that you shouldn't look around on what I do. Even the
  unfinshed projects might be a little interesting. 
  <p1>-Thank you for reading.</p1>
